    <h1> var, let, and const</h1>
    <p><strong>var: </strong>var is a function & global scoop. It can be redeclared & reassign anywhere of the code. It
        hoisting behavior is initialized with undefined.</p>
    <p><strong>let: </strong>let is a block scoop. It can't be redeclared but can be reassign anywhere of the code. It
        hoisting behavior is uninitialized.</p>
    <p><strong>const: </strong>const is a block scoop. It can't be redeclared & reassign anywhere of the code. It
        hoisting behavior is uninitialized.</p>

    <h1>null & undefined</h1>
    <p>If we declared a variable but could not define any value inside of variable. For this, result is undefined. Null
        is another thing that we can define a variable as null like let a = null; It means inside of a variable there is
        no value. So, undefined and null little difference is that we use null directly when we don't want to put value
        inside of a variable but we can't use undefined directly.</p>

    <h1>Rest API</h1>
    <p>API is Application Programming Interface which can response user quickly. It can get user information then goto
        to the server then goto database to collet data then pass data to the user. It's like when anybody order food
        after a certain time they get the food by the waiter. Here, the waiter is API.</p>
